                <p class="project_description"> 
                        Conversational AI is a major design experience class in which students build a conversational AI assistant using Clinc's 
                        platform. My team decided to create a conversational assistant for Spotify called Melody. Melody can do basic music 
                        controls such as play, pause, skip, and next/previous. Clinc's platform is built modeling a state machine, giving them
                        the distinction from other platforms such as Alexa in that the interaction with the agent is more conversational. In
                        order to really take advantage of this feature, we decided to make Melody also recommend songs based on criteria given by
                        the user, imitating the experience of interacting with a record store owner.

                <p class="project_description"> 
                        During my internship at Learning A-Z, I was given the task of creating a new method of logging in for students using Raz-Kids. 
                        Previously, they only had the option of entering a text password or clicking on an icon as a password, but with this feature they can also scan QR codes. 
                        QR codes can make logging in easier for kids who don't know how to type, and also make logging in faster. All they need to do is hold the QR code up to 
                        the camera. The project here is an isolation of my feature from the LAZ codebase, and only encompasses the main idea of the feature: logging in. Much of
                         this code is unused in the demo site, but is used in the actual feature.

                        In this Girls Encoded program led by Rada Mihalcea, participants were given the opportunity to be paired with a 
                        research mentor at the University of Michigan to experience research. I was paired with Dr. Kummerfeld, a NLP postdoc, and was given
                        this research project. The project's goal was to build a text classifier that would help emergency responders
                        filter tweets during disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, etc. Categories that tweets were labeled with
                        include a priority level (i.e. low, medium, high) and the associated event (i.e. fireColorado, westTexasExplosion). This text 
                        classifier is powered by the python spaCy library and data curated by Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) Incident Streams track. Attached
                        below is the research poster I made for the programs research symposium, showing the results of this classifier.

                <p class="project_description"> 
                        In this project sponsored by Learning A-Z, I, along with other CS and UX students, am building a tool that will allow teachers 
                        to automate assessing student recordings. In Raz-Kids, there is a specific assignment called "high frequency words" in which 
                        students record themselves saying words in the module assigned to them. Then our feature runs that recording through 
                        speech processing, compares the results to the golden standard, and displays the results in an effective report. In collaboration with the UX
                        students, we have focused a lot of attention on what teachers want out of this feature. In order to understand our users better, the UX students
                        performed user interviews and we have catered our reports to be what the teachers want.
                        
                        In addition to the technical aspects of the project, MDP focuses a lot
                        on following a professional process to complete the project including setting milestones, creating Gantt charts, presenting progress, writing
                        reports, etc. By doing this project, I have gotten a lot of exposure to real life engineering.
