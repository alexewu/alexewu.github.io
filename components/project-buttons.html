        <!-- Melody Description -->
        <h3>EECS 498 - Conversation AI Project: Melody</h3>
        <p> 
                Conversation AI is a major design experience class in which students build a conversational AI assistant using Clinc's 
                platform. My team decided to create a conversational assistant for Spotify called Melody. Melody can do basic music 
                controls such as play, pause, skip, and next/previous. Clinc's platform is built modeling a state machine, giving them
                the distinction from other platforms such as Alexa in that the interaction with the agent is more conversational. In
                order to really take advantage of this feature, we decided to make Melody also recommend songs based on criteria given by
                the user, imitating the experience of interacting with a record store owner.

                Built using: Clinc, Spotify API, Python
